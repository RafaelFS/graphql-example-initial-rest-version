# How I built this

## Intro

The goal of this document is to mainly help new people follow along my implementation and to be the basis of future posts and presentations

## Create React App

The first step was simply to run Create React App on my machine. Follow the instructions on https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app, it is much better explained.
